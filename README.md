# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

In this small project I predicted the survival of passengers using the famous Titanic Dataset. 

I used Decision Tree Classifier model for the prediction and recorded the accuracy metrics of the model then used the model on a given test dataset.

You can find the notebook here too :
